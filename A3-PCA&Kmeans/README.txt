1. How to run my code?
Task1.m implements the PCA algorithm. This cannot be run individually.
Task2.m implements the 1nn classifies the data using PCA. It can be run individually.
Task3.m & Task3s2.m implement the kmeans algorithm using two different methods to initialise the cluster centroids. They can be run.
Task4s1.m & Task4s2.m implement the kmeans algorithm, comparing two experiments about centroids updating or not. They can be run.
Task5.m & Task5s2.m conduct two experiments that adding Gaussian noise or not then compare the results of them. They can be run.
